Being new to Microservice Architecture (MSA), I wasn't sure what to expect nor did I know exactly what MSA is. When reading "Innovation Insight for Micro" by Gartner,
it was really interesting and eye opening on what MSA are, to not only its advantages but also its disadvantages. As I have stated before I didn't really have a define idea of 
what microservies were, it was just what I thought what it sounded like, which to me it was related to a reusable software/service. However, the reading definition was 
"a complex architectural paradigm that developers use to build new applications or to rearchitect existing applications". And when comparing my misconception with Gartner, 
my ideal was more of an "antipattern in the microservices paradigm" because reuse creates dependecies and affect agility. Which one of the main points for MSA is due to it's
agility to develop applications. Another benefit that caught my interest but unfortunately was only light talked about in it's benefits was MSA's "resiliency" and how 
"MSA design patterns can yield self-healing applications that can continue operating in the face of partial outages, and that can recover rapidly and gracefully". I guess this is 
more specific/situational case, there that was why it wasn't too much talked about. When further reading into the "Risks" section, I was surprised about "how costly" MSA is and
its' frequent occurance resulting in disappoint from many company. I will not lie, I wish that in the reading it provided some statistics so I can really observe the success 
rate of MSA but I'll take the reading word as benefit of the doubt and trust what it states.
