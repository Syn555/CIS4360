                                                               Cloudflare Case-Study
	        Cloudflare is a global network designed to make everything you connect to the internet secure and private. 
  Cloudflare Workers behave similar to JavaScript in the browser or in Node.js. Worker’s runtime uses the V8 engine and the runtime also 
  implements many of the standard APIs in most browsers. Instead of running on an individual machine, workers run on the Cloudflare network 
  across thousands of machines, each machine that host an instance of the workers runtime and capable of running thousands of user-define applications.
 	
          There are ways in which Cloudflare workers can be used to work as microservices or at least very similar to it. 
  “Cloudflare Workers are pieces of JavaScript code that are hosted within the Cloudflare edge network and run-in response to HTTP requests. 
  Workers behave more like functions but offer the flexibility to also work as microservices; Cloudflare does not limit the size or type 
  of Workers those developers can build and deploy.” As stated, the main difference between microservice and workers are that microservice are larger 
  and can do more than a function, which is what workers behave more as. (Note: A function is a small bit of code that performs only one action 
  in response to an event). However, even if microservice can do more than workers, it can also do the same thing as workers. For example, 
  if a developer divides an application into smaller codes each being equivalent to a size of a function. The application can then be made up of 
  multiple of functions (aka workers). The only down side is that each function can then only perform one task.
